# CustomLogger
Custom Logger API using Java Util Logger framework.

Project : Custom Logging.

This Project is used to implement custom logging library for console, file and socket using Java.

Tech Stack : Java 7.
Tools used : Eclipse Juno.

Extra : 

 1. I have implemented logging for all the three Handlers i.e. Console, File and Socket.
 2. Unit test cases for all the three handlers along with output.
 3. Documented the source code using `@JavaDoc`.


Instructions for running the project  : 

1. Unzip the file iLabs.zip in a folder.

2. Run the jar file named `iLabs.jar` from `command prompt ` using command
    
    `java -jar iLabs.jar`

3. Make sure you are listening to port 3000 as Socket Handler test case is tested on Server : localhost and Port : 135. 

4. File Handler output is in `FileHandler.txt` file.
